In less than three years, more than 3 M Swiss francs have been raised for Swiss sports and more than 500 projects have been successfully financed.  With the highest success rate of any crowdfunding platforms in the world (86% in 2016), the company has achieved ""proof of concept"" on the Swiss market. As the platform focuses exclusively on sports projects, IBIY has been able to establish a unique business model: the company generates revenues and sponsoring fees from big companies (such as PostFinance, Helsana, Ochsner Sport, etc), who are using the platform for CSR & sponsorship campaigns. Therefore IBIY can cover its operating costs on the Swiss market. Together with the local National Olympic Committee, IBIY started to operate in November 2014 in Austria, where the platform is NR. 1 in online sports funding as well.  The strategy is to build up local markets in cooperation with local athletes and important players in sports. Therefore IBIY will establish new branches and provide them with licences (including the know-how, the software and marketing concepts).  The goal is to expand to 12-16 countries within the next four years.

Prodibi SA,"High-quality, powerful and easy way to showcase images beautifully","Prodibi is a unique photography infrastructure as a service. It is simple, the way we display images online doesn’t make any sense anymore. We are photographers ourselves, and we were frustrated to degrade our photos to show them online. We decided to rebuild the image workflow and the online visual experience entirely.  We solve all significant issues of displaying images online without slowing down websites, from the quality and size of photos to their formatting, compression, responsiveness, cropping, pixel density, color management, and security. The web platform we built on our iaas targets mainly photographers, but we also help enterprises, and agencies with their image need thanks to our APIs and plugins. In details:- You can upload your images in full quality and full size directly (up to 3 gigapixels), we take the maximum resolution and preserve it (jpeg, raw, psd, tiff).- You can easily embed your full-resolution photos to your website without slowing down your pages (like a Youtube video).- Zoom to the 100% size of your images without losing in quality.- Allow the download of you full-resolution images with custom settings and expiration dates.- Enable extra security for the pictures that matter the most. The security you wonder?  While it is impossible to guarantee 100% safety, Prodibi images are more secure than standard pictures by nature since only the parts and resolution needed are streamed to the viewers. The original image is never sent to the device of the viewer unless the download capacity is enabled. On top, right-click on the pictures is disabled, and all new albums are by default privates.To strengthen even more the security you can enable URL encryption, image encryption, watermarking, and stealth mode. The encryption and watermarking of photos can always be on or only when zoomed in at 100% to ensure the best compromise between quality, performance, and security. You can check our web service here; it is free: www.prodibi.com We also have a blog, a newsletter, and a Facebook group in which we share a weekly dose of stunning photos, please visit: mag.prodibi.com and www.facebook.com/groups/111916462828206 You can also find us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram @Prodibi",15.04.2011,Plan-Les-Ouates,"['ICT', 'Applications', 'Big Data', 'Cloud', 'Consumer', 'Enterprise', 'Internet', 'Media', 'SaaS', 'Software']","{'linkedin': 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/proteomedix-ag', 'fb': 'https://www.facebook.com/Prodibi', 'twitter': 'https://twitter.com/prodibi', 'ig': 'http://instagram.com/prodibi', 'home': 'http://prodibi.com'}","['TOP 100 Swiss Startups 2016', 'Venture Leaders Technology 2016', 'IMD 2015 Startup Competition']",https://www.venturelab.swiss/Prodibi

Nezasa AG,Technology solutions for the travel trade,"Nezasa’s technology is the first ever to provide a seamless end-to-end process for the planning and booking of complex individual travel packages. Our platform eliminates all media breaks from the inspiration phase until the post-booking and travel phase. It can handle various ways of products. We’ve started with complex individual roundtrips in Asia (containing hotels, transfers, and all sorts of excursions), have built support for river and island cruises, and will grow into other package types such as self-drives and group tours with flexible extensions next. Our platform also significantly simplifies the whole distribution chain for these products. Companies using the Nezasa platform can have two roles in our business model: supplier and/or retailer. A retailer in our model is any company that sells packages to an end customer. It can be a travel agent, an OTA, a tour operator or DMC who does direct distribution, or even non-travel company who sells travel packages, e.g. an online magazine who sells trips related to the magazine topic. A supplier can be a DMC, a tour operator or even a more specialized provider of travel products. With our platform, retailers get new, flexible ways to source packages. They can decide from whom to source the packages (based on a global marketplace) and whether they want to be simple re-sellers or be responsible for the fulfillment.

Legal Technology Switzerland AG (Proxeus),We create an interface allowing users to easily create their own decentralized applications on the blockchain,"The blockchain and smart contract universe is currently only visible to parties that are running a node, use a client or have access to a blockchain-enabled service. Most of today’s systems rely on legacy infrastructure and are not yet able to interact directly with blockchains. New interfaces must be developed in order to give them access to the benefits provided by decentralised ledgers. Today, blockchain technology is only accessible to large companies with a sizeable budget to invest as almost everything must be created from scratch. When the Internet gained momentum, tools and solution-suites emerged which enabled users to quickly deploy a standardized application and to tailor it to fit the use-case perfectly. Wordpress for example is the tool that is most often used today to build web-pages - yet the look and size of the pages differ widely. In the blockchain space, Proxeus is solving that problem by providing a flexible, blockchain-compatible application-backbone that anyone can use to structure their business processes. In this way, Proxeus enables both traditional and crypto-companies to digitize and run their legal, financing, sales, production, human resources or payment processes, in a decentralised environment.",22.07.2016,Zug,"['ICT', 'Blockchain', 'Fintech', 'Enterprise', 'Internet', 'Marketplace', 'Open source', 'Services for companies', 'Services for consumers']","{'linkedin': 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/legaltech-ch/about/', 'twitter': 'https://twitter.com/proxeusapp?lang=en', 'home': 'http://www.proxeus.com'}",['TOP 100 Swiss Startups 2018'],https://www.venturelab.swiss/LegalHub
Future Instruments Sàrl,Google apps for touch screens,"We develop Web-based applications that aim to revolutionize the way people work, learn, create and communicate. Although they can be used with traditional mouse and keyboard, our applications have been designed from the ground up for touchscreen interaction, and with the goal to use screens of all sizes, from mobile devices to giant interactive walls. Our applications are based on an entirely new approach to user interfaces that make computers and devices more fun and intuitive to use than ever. They include advanced features such as multi-user interaction, remote collaboration, and seamless transfer of information from one screen to the other. The fields of applications are numerous and range from entertainment to collaborative working and learning, games, interactive presentations, and much more. Currently we develop our business following a B2B model, focusing on the collaboration and communication sectors. Our customers include schools, universities, corporate companies, SME’s, and private organisations. They use our applications to do interactive presentations, training sessions, brainstorming workshops, control displays during conferences, and for special events. Therefore, our applications are specially adapted for live use and places where people gather to work, learn, create and communicate: meeting rooms, board rooms, training rooms, classrooms, conference rooms, and exhibition centers. Just in Switzerland, the addressable market for ""tools to share, present and collaborate"" is estimated to CHF 45M / year in a SAAS model (Software As A Service). If we look at the market for tools to share, present, and collaborate, there are many competitors for each of those three activities taken individually. There are much less competitors that offer an integrated approach and even less with a similar approach to user interaction. We know only of three: Multitaction, Prysm, and Bluescape. However, their products are not based on web technologies and cannot be scaled on a SAAS model. Therefore, our closest competitors are certainly Google Jamboard and Microsoft Surface Hub, although those products come with dedicated screens and do not offer all the possibilities that we propose. Also, our concept goes far beyond group collaboration. Our goal is to develop an entire ecosystem around our platform, with the creation of a dedicated marketplace where third party developers will be able to sell objects and applications created on our platform, while the community will be able to share content created with the various applications.",17.01.2012,Lausanne,"['ICT', 'Applications', 'Cloud', 'Marketplace', 'Sensors', 'SaaS', 'Software']","{'fb': 'https://www.facebook.com/FutureInstruments', 'twitter': 'https://twitter.com/futureinstrmnts', 'home': 'http://future-instruments.com'}","[""Venture Kick (10'000) 2009"", 'IMD 2014 Startup Competition']",https://www.venturelab.swiss/Future

Doodle AG,Easy scheduling,"Some questions are more informative than their answers. This was the kind of question posed to Paul Sevinç, co-founder of Doodle, during a recent event at the Technopark Lucerne. An audience member wanted to know how Doodle deals with the enormous responsibility of having thousands of Swiss so dependent on the reliable operation of this event scheduler. Doodle has fundamentally changed how events are scheduled in Switzerland. The tool has a million users each month in this country alone, but they make up just a small fraction of all the Doodlers out there. Each month, a total of more than nine million people coordinate their business and leisure events with Doodle. ""We’re by far the most popular supplier of this service anywhere in the world,"" says co-founder and CEO Michael Näf. The basis for this rapid increase in user numbers is the tool’s built-in growth mechanism. Once someone sets up an event poll, all the participants see the advantages of Doodle. Some of them will then use the platform themselves, which in the next step increases the circle of users even more. People who try Doodle once stick with it thanks in large part to its user-friendly operation ¬¬– which is due to more than just its lack of unnecessary technical bells and whistles. The reworking of the mobile version this year clearly showed the Doodle team’s thorough approach to product development. Before releasing the new version, the company surveyed 1,400 users around the world to find out how they use their mobile phones when accessing the Internet.",08.11.2006,Zürich,"['ICT', 'Software']",{'home': 'http://www.doodle.ch'},"['TOP 100 Swiss Startups 2011', 'CH Open Source Business Case Award 2010', 'CTI Start-up Label 2008', 'IMD 2008 Startup Competition']",https://www.venturelab.swiss/Doodle
